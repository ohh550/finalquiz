                                Yes, the right answer is the Republic of Korea Army. There could be a brand that some
                                people might know but it is not for this time. It is South Korea just in case people do not
                                know.

                            <p class="text">
                                The Korean Army used to be 2 years but as time is passing it decreased to 1 year and 6
                                months at its lowest possible but slowly will be increasing. Due to more training being
                                done in the army than the air force, the air force in Korea is the only place where their
                                service is 2 years long.

                            <p class="text">
                                Military Reserve Force is something that is happening in South Korea as Korean men
                                joins the army without choice and still has to take care of their lives after such as job or
                                anything but after finishing their service all South Korean men has to go back to any
                                bases in the army once a year to remember their training until the age of 40.

                            <p class="text">
                                You probably knew the answer or even if not yes the answer is they are forced to join
                                and still you get a point for answering by volunteering as that is another way to join the
                                army if you are taking it as a job. However, it is mandatory to join for all Korean men as
                                South Korea and North Korea is still at peace agreement and that is why most Korean
                                men do not want to waste their time at the army while so many of their friends are going
                                ahead and the stresses we gain inside the army is too much and feels like we are being
                                slowed down by purpose.

                            <p class="text">
                                In the South Korea Army the normal salary per month is about 350 dollars. It's really low
                                compared to the other services in other countries. There could be a reason for this as
                                South Korea trainings are done safely with each other and no soldiers are sent to the
                                other countries unless they sign up for it.

                            <p class="text">
                                The average number of targets that Korean men can shoot are 16-18 at least. People
                                might think we are exaggerating but I can tell you it is not because during their shooting
                                training they will not let you go back to the camp base to rest until you pass the test
                                which is the 16 shots at lowest. Many shoot 20 out of 20 as soldiers could get a
                                vacation if they have perfect scores in training.

                                This answer is similar to something you have answered from above and Yes! It is
                                because they are still at war with North Korea. It may look peaceful here and always
                                hoping it will end peacefully but inside the army they are always prepared for war.

                            <p class="text">
                                This could be a tough question to answer as this really happens in the Army in South
                                Korea. We will be taught how to wear the mask quickly during training at our best and
                                timed at the same time. Then one day they will put you in a room covered with a captain
                                in the middle of the room with a gas mask on and open the gas while the doors are
                                blocked outside so we cannot break out of the room and then wear the mask. However
                                we take off the mask in the middle and are told to hold breath to endure the pain when it
                                might happen in real life.
