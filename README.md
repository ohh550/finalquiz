# Project 5 Interactive Quiz

For Project #5, In our final project, we will be tasked with using older HTML/CSS concepts 
such as DOM elements: input, forms, and buttons, and newer Javascript concepts like localStorage, 
to create an interactive quiz or tool! While our quiz or tool can be about anything, it must center 
a specific group/demographic/community and provide some kind of experience or opportunity to the 
group. We can choose to define that community and what it means for us, on our own terms and just 
be sure and explicit about who it is for, and why weâ€™re making it.

## Design Process

For my design process I decided that I wanted to create an interactive quiz and a quiz that was
related to me somehow. Which became the topic of ROKA. Republic of Korea Army. I was writing down
my memories and researching properly to understand more about the Korea Army because some of the
topics in Korea Army exsists in only South Korea. One of them could be the Reserve Forces. Also
having colors of the site was not thought about at first and slowly changed something related to
army in green. The quiz will be understanding and learning about ROKA. Hoping that it interest people
and tell others to test if they know it too.

## Refelction

The making process was harder as it had to be clickable and also show results using the localStorage
that I was not familiar with. The results page was where it had to have answers and the choices of the 
quiz that users will be clicking was hard to create as I was only able to show answers at first without
scores but managed to make it. If I had more time I would decorate the site that I have created more in
a visual way so that the users who are taking my interactive quiz could understand better with the visuals.
Also worried that no one is interested into this topic but hope that somehow it interests them and learn
cool army information that only exsists in South Korea and also know how it was hard for me to experience 
it too.
